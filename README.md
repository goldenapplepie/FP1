## My Library: Math library
My name: Jennifer Green

My original plan was to use the library "mode-lambda: the best 2D graphics of the 90s, today!" mostly because of the name (and also the documentary was written by Professor McCarthy).  However, I decided that it was too close to the racket/draw library, and so went with the math library instead.  I chose this library because being able to solve complex math problems without having to write the underlying structures yourself is incredibly useful.  I decided to screw around with matrixes and stats a little bit.  I would have liked to do more with statistics, I feel like what I have is so simple.  

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![code_sample](/code_sample.jpg?raw=true "sample of code")

```
code?
```
